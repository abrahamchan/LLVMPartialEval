## Implementation of Partial Evaluation on LLVM

The partial evaluation compiler optimization consists of two separate modules:

1. Input Substitution
2. Selective Inlining

Additionally, there are two implementation versions of these modules.
One for LLVM 3.7.1, and the other for LLVM 3.4 (suitable for integration with LLFI).
