\section{Background and Motivating Example}

In this section, we illustrate a functional example of our proposed partial evaluation compiler transformation.
Consider the following code snippet.
The figure on the left shows the unoptimized program, while the figure on the right shows the partial evaluation optimization.
Notice that the function call to foo2 is replaced with a constant instead.
Note that the actual transformation is performed at the IR level, not through source code.
