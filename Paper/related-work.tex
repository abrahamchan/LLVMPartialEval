\section{Related Work}

Since Futamura first proposed the use of compile time partial evaluation in the 1970â€™s [10], partial evaluation has been well explored under different contexts such as eliminating I/O operations to reduce overhead of unnecessary disk I/O access [11], removing code duplication in residual programs [12], implementing inline functions to save function call overheads [13], and instrumenting interpreters to reduce loop-invariant code [14].
However, to our knowledge, we are the first to propose the evaluation of system-level reliability for program partial evaluations.
