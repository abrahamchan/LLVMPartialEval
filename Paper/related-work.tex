Since Futamura first proposed the use of compile time partial evaluation in the 1970â€™s~\cite{Futamura}, partial evaluation has been well explored under different contexts such as eliminating I/O operations to reduce overhead of unnecessary disk I/O access~\cite{Smowton}, removing code duplication in residual programs~\cite{Debois}, implementing inline functions to save function call overheads~\cite{Jones1996}, and instrumenting interpreters to reduce loop-invariant code~\cite{Jones1993}.
However, to our knowledge, we are the first to propose the evaluation of system-level reliability for program partial evaluations.
